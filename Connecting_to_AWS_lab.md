# Connecting to AWS

## Introduction

This lab guides you through the steps involved in connecting to an AWS EC2 F1 instance, and starting and stopping the instance.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Connect to an AWS EC2 F1 instance using the provided credentials
- Starting an instance
- Starting a RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) session
- Closing the RDP session
- Stopping the instance

## Procedure

This lab is separated into steps that consist of general overview statements that provide information on the detailed instructions that follow. Follow these detailed instructions to progress through the lab.

This lab comprises of three primary steps: You will login into an AWS and start an EC2 F1 instance. You will then interact with the instance remote desktop client, and then finally stop the running instance. Procedure on using PuTTy is provided in the Appendix.

## Step 1: Login into the AWS and starting an F1 instance

#### Each registered participant has been allocated a preconfigured EC2 F1 instance and should have received an email with the following details:
- Account ID, 
- IAM username, 
- Link to access a preconfigured EC2 F1 instance

### 1.1. Open a web browser and login into AWS EC2 F1 instance using the provided credentials
**1.1.1.** Start a web browser session

**1.1.2.** Either click on the provided link to open up an AWS login page OR enter [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) to open a login page

If you had used the link then you should see a login page similar to shown here:
![alt tag](./images/Fig1-1.png)
#### Figure 1. Login page accessed through the provided link

If you had not used the link you may be directed to the AWS standard login page
![alt tag](./images/Fig1-2.png)
#### Figure 2. Entering credentials manually

Enter *xilinx-aws-f1-developer-labs* in the Email address field and click **Next** to see the login page similar to shown in **Figure 1**

**1.1.3.** Enter _userxx_ in the **IAM user name** field and enter the provided password in the **Password** field

**1.1.4.** Click **Sign In**
### 1.2. Make sure to select N. Virginia (or instructor indicated region) as the region and start the instance
**1.2.1.** In the top right corner, using the drop-down button, select a region with F1 instances, such as **N. Virginia** (**US East)**
![alt tag](./images/Fig1-3.png)
#### Figure 3. Selecting region

If you select different region other then where the accounts are created for then you may not see your instance as well as the source files which are pre-loaded for the workshop.

**1.2.2.** Click on the **EC2** link on the dashboard or if not visible, then click on the _Services_ drop-down button and then click on **EC2**

**1.2.3.** Click on the **Instances** link on the left panel

![alt tag](./images/Fig1-5.png)
#### Figure 5. Accessing Instances

You may see several instances

**1.2.4.** Enter your username in the filter field just below the **Launch Instance** button and hit enter

#### Figure 6. Filtering your instance

**1.2.5.** Making sure that your instance is selected, click on the **Actions &gt; Instance State &gt; Start**
![alt tag](./images/Fig1-7.png)
#### Figure 7. Starting an instance

**1.2.6.** Click on the **Yes, Start** button

**1.2.7.** Click on the refresh button(![alt tag](./images/Fig1-refresh.png)) to see the updated status to _Running_

![alt tag](./images/Fig1-8.png)
#### Figure 8. Running state

**1.2.8.** Make a note of the Public DNS and IPv4 Public IP which will be used by PuTTy and Remote Desktop (RDP)

#### Figure 9. Assigned IP to the running instance

## Step 2: Interacting with the Instance using RDP

**You can communicate with the instance using command line through PuTTY or Git Bash, and using GUI through remote desktop (RDP) connection.**

**2.1. Start a remote desktop session**

**2.1.1.** Start the remote desktop session

**2.1.2.** Enter the _IPv4_ address

**2.1.3.** Click on the **Show Options**

![alt tag](./images/Fig1-13.png)
#### Figure 10. Entering the IPv4 address

**2.1.4.** Select the **Display** tab and select _True Color (24 bit)_ and click **Connect**

#### Figure 11. Selecting resolution and connecting

**2.1.5.** A certificate warning will be displayed. Click **Yes** to open the RDP session

**2.1.6.** Enter centos as the username and enter the provided password and click OK

#### Figure 13. The RDP desktop

**2.1.8.** Right-click on the desktop and select **Open Terminal** to open a window

**2.1.9.** You should enter the following commands in any newly opened terminal window to source the environments

   ```
      cd ~/aws-fpga	  
      source sdaccel_setup.sh	  
      source $XILINX_SDX/settings64.sh
   ```

## Step 3: Stopping the Instance and Signing Out

**It is important to shut down the instance in order to stop billing meter**

### 3.1. Shut down the RDP instance using the top Power OFF button.

**3.1.1.** Click on the Power OFF button ![alt tag](./images/Fig1-stop.png) located on the top right corner

**3.1.2.** A window will show up showing settings, lock, and power off buttons. Click on the Power OFF button
